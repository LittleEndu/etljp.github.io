# Effort to Learn Japanese

Hey you found my place where I for once actually try to learn Japanese, from song lyrics.

Currently, there's no easy way to navigate the songs available.

### Contributing

If for what ever reason you want to contribute to this madness, copy one of the existing songs' html and start from there.
Make sure to add furigana to **every** kanji, even simple N5 kanji like ä»Š should have furigana. 
Don't forget to add some kinda translation, hopefully you will highlight some words and actually try to understand the song.
There are no other requirements.
